> Here’s the trick: do not bother trying to comprehend or understand the text [of Deleuze].  A desire for that level of control will only hinder your ability to experience it, use it, think it, and become it.
- [Christopher Higgs](http://htmlgiant.com/random/the-beginners-guide-to-deleuze/)

## Preface / Rambling (can be skipped)

Philosophy is a hobby for me, and I hold no purist tendencies towards it. I come to it on whim and leave in the same manner. Deleuze is someone who I stumbled upon by chance about a month ago and ever since, there is something about him I cannot shake off. I generally wander through literature and philosophy - and though many have captured my attention almost immediately, Deleuze is the only one to have captured my imagination in such a manner. Under Deleuze, it feels like everything is about to change. The theories sit like amorphous blobs of potential, of energy, colour, and vibrance. Everything is vivid but elusive. It feels as if he is housing a micro internet with obscure, strange connections like a Wonderland Alice would fall into.

It is possible that what I have been enchanted with is merely some projection or fantasy of my intellect and that I will find in Deleuze nothing to sustain my imagination for long. But it is possible that it will change my life. I cannot know until I know, until we go to whatever ends. Regardless, I've decided to write as I study - maybe as an exercise of sorts, or as a performance.

I'll be covering whatever of Deleuze I am engaged with, in a student-teacher manner. I am not a philosopher, I do not intend to write for philosophers. It's quite possible I'll be completely off the mark at times, I will write to the best of my understanding. Searching for blog posts about Deleuze has either resulted in philosophy majors copying the elitist French style of writing (i.e. intentionally exclusive) or poetic pieces with obscure reference such that it'll read well but I come out with nothing of tangible understanding. Maybe it is because people are a little afraid to say "Deleuze means..." in lucid terms in fear of being in error (a very non-Deleuzian approach...) or maybe the only way to follow Deleuze is in such an elusive manner. Another thing I will find out. My attitude while writing will be of C.S. Lewis:

> I write for the unlearned about things in which I am unlearned myself… It often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better than the master can... The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met. The expert met it so long ago that he has forgotten... I write as one amateur to another, talking about difficulties I have met, or lights I have gained...

Don't get me wrong, there are certainly texts and lectures out there simplifying Deleuze (most of which I'll be using myself), the challenge is they are still by philosophers and are often riddled (unintentionally) with assumed knowledge on the readers part. In that sense, this is also a sort of creative experiment for myself, as an amateur/hobbyist, to attempt writing and clarifying as I study under the public eye.

Lastly, I titled this 'sensing' Deleuze (in his terms as well), which I think is probably a better description for what I'm trying to do rather than the usual 'understanding'. What I'd like is a feel of it even if the complete mechanism eludes me.
