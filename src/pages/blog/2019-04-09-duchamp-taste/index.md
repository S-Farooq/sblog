I've been deeply lost in Duchamp recently and it has nothing to do with his Art. In fact, I've barely looked at his art - I almost don't even want to. It's his personality, his 'taste', and ideas that have encapsulated my interest. (Even this approach seems to be Duchamp's initial instructions when he says 'I don't believe in Art - I believe in the Artist.)

But it's hard - surround Duchamp are all these deepities that make you feel like you've learned and understood 'so much' but when you sit to really think about it, or get into conversation with another, you're tongue-tied. It's as if there is nothing to say but 'Duchamp said this and that, Duchamp was so and so, So and so said this about Duchamp' - everything surrounds him. Is there anything that goes beyond?

Recently, reading James Moretti's Distant Reading has inspired me to adopt a grounding for my thoughts in an intuitive, familiar format. Ultimately, literature (and I am treating Duchamp and everything he has come to represent as literature) can be seen as a response to solve 'symbolic' problems. Politics, society, culture, etc. generate a 'state' of the world that contains symbolic tensions which literature is tasks to resolve. What then, are the symbolic tensions that Duchamp seeks to resolve - what, why, and how?
