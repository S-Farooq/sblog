 I began this blog at the start of 2019 as a project of sorts - it barely has structure or consistency, which is how all good projects should start (I think). After graduating, I've tried to be more attentive - capturing floating thoughts and content from left and right. This is an attempt at an evolution - attention with consolidation. Consolidation is a process of solidification, a sort of an end-of-day inventory check of the brain; what stayed, what didn't, what's lingering.

 On a quarterly basis, I want to complete an *inventory* check of what's crossed my mind - what's been significant and made an impact. (Inspired by what Alan Jacobs does weekly if you follow his newsletter). The idea is to solidify the quarter, to end with a statement of *what it was* - this creates a mental entity that occupies a place in the mind, providing a reference for future thoughts. (Freezing water into ice cubes makes it easier to carry it with your hands). Here goes.

# Report Guidelines

> Note that these are in no particular order.

> Note that I will always certainly miss including important things in retrospect - but maybe that's for the best.

> Note that to reduce disorder, I have 2 categories an item can fall into: What I **Loved** and what I **Liked**.

### What I Loved (Bolded Items)
I have specific definition for *Love*. Love for me is *'that which we come back to'* - if I didn't access the material again after some time apart (rewatched an episode, read a chapter again, thought about it more later, etc.), it's not love. And I also think we shouldn't be shy to include past discovered items if they made an impact again. By definition, these items don't have a one-time usage policy.

### What I Liked (Normal Text)
Everything that I didn't love (i.e. haven't come back to *yet*) but it had a significant enough impact to include. These items have potential that could lead to love. Maybe they'll appear as loved ones in future reports.
