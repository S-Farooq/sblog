I've modified Bob Dylan's ['7 Simple Rules for a Life in Hiding'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY-72EaL0TQ) to create **7 Simple Rules for a Life [of Authentic Relevance]**.

> **One,** never trust a cop *~~in a raincoat~~*. <br/>
> **Two,** beware of [anything devoid of] enthusiasm and of love, *~~each~~* *it* is temporary and quick to sway. <br/>
> **Three,** if asked if you care about the world's problems, look deep into the eyes of *~~he who asks~~* *the one's you love*, *~~he~~* *they* will never ask you again. <br/>
> **Four,** never give your *~~real~~* name. <br/>
> **Five,** if ever asked to look at yourself, *~~don't~~* *take your time*. <br/>
> **Six,** *~~never~~* do anything the person standing in front of you ~~cannot understand~~ *can learn*. <br/>
> and finally **Seven,** *~~never~~* create anything, [though] it will be misinterpreted, it will chain you and follow you for the rest of your life.

(The original rules appeared from the character of [Arthur Rimbaud](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/10/arthur-rimbaud-edmund-white) in ['I'm Not There' - a musical drama of 'ruminations on the life of Bob Dylan, where six characters embody a different aspect of the musician's life and work'](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368794/). The rules are an adaptation from Bob Dylan's poem ['Advice for Geraldine on her Miscellaneous Birthday'](https://www.deviantart.com/eduarte/journal/Advice-For-Geraldine-On-Her-Miscellaneous-Birthday-236303346).)
