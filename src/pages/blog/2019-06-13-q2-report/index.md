# Report Guidelines

> Note that these are in no particular order.

> Note that I will always certainly miss including important things in retrospect - but maybe that's for the best.

> Note that to reduce disorder, I have 2 categories an item can fall into: What I **Loved** and what I **Liked**.

### What I Loved (Bolded Items)
I have specific definition for *Love*. Love for me is *'that which we come back to'* - if I didn't access the material again after some time apart (rewatched an episode, read a chapter again, thought about it more later, etc.), it's not love. And I also think we shouldn't be shy to include past discovered items if they made an impact again. By definition, these items don't have a one-time usage policy.

### What I Liked (Normal Text)
Everything that I didn't love (i.e. haven't come back to *yet*) but it had a significant enough impact to include. These items have potential that could lead to love. Maybe they'll appear as loved ones in future reports.
