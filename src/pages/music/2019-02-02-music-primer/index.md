My process for listening to Music is simple [(almost analogous to the process of finding something to think about)](/thinking-is-love).
Exploration -> Casual Listening -> Focused Listening -> (Build a Narrative)

I let this happen for a while (2 weeks?), and if during these casual periods a song manages to yank my attention to itself, I note the album, preparing for dissection.

## Focused Listening
Externally, this is not very different from Casual Listening except that internally, I am focused - keenly observing how the music and words are making me feel. Generally, I find myself gradually answering 3 questions:
